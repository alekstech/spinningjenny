# Volunteer shift management platform
## Toronto Textile Museum

I put together a skeleton. It's built on NodeJS so you'll need Node installed on your machine. The app server is called Express. The front end is React.

- Node is the engine that lets us run JavaScript.
- Express is the traffic warden that serves HTML and CSS files depending on what URL a user requests. Express also will have a link to our PostgreSQL database and will pass data back and forth between it and the front end generated by React. Express lives in the main directory of this repo. To start it, go to the repo folder in your command line and run 'npm install', followed by 'npm start'. You should then see 'Welcome to the TM Volunteer Center API server' at [http://localhost:5035/]('http://localhost:5035/')
- React will serve the front end. It has its own, bult-in server. React lives in the 'tm' directory. To start it, go to the 'tm' folder in your command line and run 'npm install', followed by 'npm start'. You should then see 'Welcome, Textile Museum Volunteer' at [http://localhost:3000/]('http://localhost:3000/')
