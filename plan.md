# TMC Volunteer Association Information System
The goal of this software is to support the volunteer association by:

* providing up-to-date contact information for coordinators
* allowing volunteers to self-manage their personal information and privacy
* giving control to volunteers so that they only get relevant information
* automating toil done by coordinators and staff
* track hours

## Reports
The system should provide the following information to the following people:

* emergency contact information to staff and off-site coordinators
* active volunteer names and membership numbers to staff
* contact information to coordinators as permitted by volunteers' privacy settings
* names and email addresses to Strand News for the volunteers who have requested it
* names and email addresses to the sale coordinator for the volunteers who have requested it
* awards and time volunteering to the executive
* vacancies in the permanent shifts
* hours by area and volunteers to the executive

## Plan
To build out the system as planned, we propose working in stages.

### Stage 1
Basic information management

* create a way for volunteers to edit the personal information they have previously provided
* prepare active volunteer information for membership
* prepare emergency contact information
* prepare Strand News list

### Stage 2
Have scheduling for reception handled by the system

* have the permanent shifts stored in the system
* generate a schedule for next month
* allow volunteers to see their shifts and unclaimed shifts
* allow volunteers to claim or vacate shifts
* do “fair” tie-breaking for shifts which multiple floaters are interested in
* send email to staff, coordinator, and floaters for shifts vacated
* produce vacancy report for HR
* produce weekly roster for staff

### Stage 3

* allow trainees to select shifts to shadow
* allow volunteers to swap shifts
* allow volunteers to contact each other (given privacy rules)
* produce award report
* allow HR to add awards to volunteers

### Stage 4

* allow volunteers to enter supplementary hours
* consider online hour tracking in place of volunteer log sheets (opt-in/supplementary)
