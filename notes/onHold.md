- Are users of the site referred to as Users or Volunteers?
- Are we referring to areas as teams, areas, or placement areas?
- What areas are there? (List needed.)
- We decided to remove the Skills section of the profile. If we want to include it, I have two questions. What are the skills users can choose from? Do we want to allow an 'other' text box?
